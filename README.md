# NCAABracketMaker
In Example.py, enter year, league, and coefficients for algorithm (win, rank, points, and schedule). Run the 
bracketmaker function. If you are running it for the first time, data will be pulled in, it will take about 10mins 
to run. Once complete, the bracket results are stored in SimBrackets/Sim_Bracket.xlsx. You can switch between results 
with the drop down list in C4. To delete sim results set reset value to True.
